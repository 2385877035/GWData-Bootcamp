Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Gravitational Wave Data Exploration Bootcamp Series! 
This course is meticulously designed to provide a solid foundation in programming, operational knowledge, and data-driven modeling skills centered around gravitational wave data analysis and research.

## Training Objectives
- Equip participants with robust programming and operational skills, and foundational training in data-driven modeling, focusing on gravitational wave data analysis and related research areas.
- Discuss the common research methodologies combining gravitational wave data processing with AI technologies, with hands-on examples and projects for practical understanding and mastery.
- Analyze cutting-edge deep learning models and apply them to real-world gravitational wave data analysis problems through specific case studies.

## Target Audience
- Undergraduate and graduate students interested in data analysis and algorithm development, especially those focusing on gravitational wave data processing and related research.
- The course also welcomes undergraduates with a basic programming background, looking to enhance their data analysis skills or with an interest in gravitational wave data processing.
- Future professionals aspiring to work in space-based gravitational wave detection projects and related research fields.

## Course Design Philosophy
- Drawing from past teaching experiences and identified knowledge gaps in student research projects, the course introduces relevant concepts and common methods to ensure comprehensive understanding and application in research.
- The course is scheduled weekly or bi-weekly, each session lasting about 3 hours, combining online and offline methods (腾讯会议) to ensure interactivity and practicality.
- The curriculum is expected to be offered once per semester or annually, with continual updates and enrichment based on student feedback and research demands.
